# Team Charter Workshop

## Goal

By the end of this  6-7 hour workshop, your should have a team charter with the following components:

* A purpose statement
* A set of meeting norms
* A list of team responsiblities, as statements
* A set of team goals and measurements for which the agrees they will be held accountable
* A set of ground rules for day-to-day actions and decision making. 

## Setup and Supplies

* One pad of Post-It easel paper (for sticking post-its to and sticking on wall around rooom
* Several yellow post-it pads
* Several black sharpies
* Avery colored dots (for focusing)
* A laptop for drafting final results
* coffee, snacks, lunch
* A large whiteboard with dry-erase makers (for notes, distilling)

## Part One: Determine where you are starting

Break the group into groups of two, or if the team is too small, do this individually:

On a scale of 1-5, (1 = weak, 3=satisfactory, 5=Strong) rate where you feel the team is on these factors:

* **Results**  "Are we deilvering the most valuble thing consistantly?"
* **Commitment**  "Are we bonded as a team? Do we work together well? Are we committed to doing our best work together?"
* **Process** "Are our meetings providing value? Are we hitting our deadlines? Do we understand how work is to be completed? Are we efficient and focused?"
* **Communication** "Are there conflicts in the team? Is everyone participating in discussions? Are we open to everyones' opinions and ideas?"
* **Trust** "Is the team working from a place of mutual respect? Do people feel they can ask for help? Can we trust one another to bring our best work to the table?"

Give everyone about ten minutes to rate these, and jot down their thoughts. At the end of ten minutes, ask each group to write their ratings on the board, and discuss why they rated each item as they did. Display all the ratings, focusing on how alike or diffent people feel about where the team is. Reccord this matirx for later. 

### Why did we do this?

The above section is your **before** metric. After a few months, you'll want to do this exercise again with the team after the team charter in in place. 

Each of these topics relates to a different part of the charter. The rest of the day will break down each of these topics into a set of brainstorms and focusing sessions. The charter you craft will fine tune each of these subjects. 

* Purpose Statement - Results, Commitment
* Meeting Norms - Communication, Commitment, Results, Trust, Process
* Responsibilties - Committment, Results
* Team Goals and Measures - Results, Process, Commitment
* Ground Rules - Trust, Communication, Process

## Part Two: Purpose

### Brainstorm

For ten minutes, do a post-it note brainstorming session focusing on the follow question:

**"What is it that we do and no one else in the organization can?"**

### Focus

Using colored dot stickers, ask the team to dot the following. 

* Red: Most important things we do (2-3 stickers)
* Green: Most exciting things we do (2 stickers)
* Blue: Most difficult things we do (2 stickers)

### Distill

Have the team group the items by subject, and record on new post-its the subjects. You will use these later. 

### Finish

Set these aside for later.
